# C-Hashmap
Hashmap implementation in C

This is a version of Java's HashMap implementation written in C. With
this project, I'm hoping to deepen my understanding of data structures
and how they function on a lower level.

UPDATES:
    10/3/2023: This is the start. I actually found out earlier that my
    understanding of hashmaps on a fundamental level is spotty, at best.
    After spending a lot of time researching, I feel much more confident
    that I can finish this project. For now, I simply want some way to
    create a very barebones implementation of a hashmap to where I have
    functioning key/value pairs, then I'll go from there with the
    remaining functions (put, remove, etc etc.)

TODO:
    - Write tests for existing functions
    - Write more detailed comments for each function

In the future I'm hoping to add more features to this hashmap, such as:
- Dynamic sizing
- Generic implementation
