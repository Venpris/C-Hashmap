# C-Hashmap
Hashmap implementation in C

This is a version of Java's HashMap implementation written in C. With
this project, I'm hoping to deepen my understanding of data structures
and how they function on a lower level.

UPDATES:
    - 10/3/2023: This is the start. I actually found out earlier that my
    understanding of hashmaps on a fundamental level is spotty, at best.
    After spending a lot of time researching, I feel much more confident
    that I can finish this project. For now, I simply want some way to
    create a very barebones implementation of a hashmap to where I have
    functioning key/value pairs, then I'll go from there with the
    remaining functions (put, remove, etc etc.)

    - 10/8/2023: I'm now able to create and hash a hash table, which is
    pretty good. The put function still isn't fully working yet, but I'm
    planning on getting that sorted out soon. I wrote some unit tests
    (for the first time in C as well!) and now I want to use the
    debugger to hopefully get all 3 tests passing, but I'm still having
    a little trouble setting that up.

TODO:
    - Make tests pass
    - Start on remaining API functions

In the future I'm hoping to add more features to this hashmap, such as:
- Dynamic sizing
- Generic implementation

Written in C on Visual Studio Code Community Edition and uses Unity v2.5.2
